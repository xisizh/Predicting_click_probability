# Predicting_click_probability

Predicting click probability to measure the popularity of advertisements.

Trained a Logistic Regression model training data, under stream data setting using Stochastic Gradient Descent. Implemented 
an unbiased hash kernel to hash unknown number of features into a smaller space. Ran SGD on the hashed feature space, with 
sparse updating and delayed regularization. Implemented a personalized click estimation, decreasing error by 0.04.

Some skeleton code can be found on UW website.
